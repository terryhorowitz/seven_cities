what we need our sockets to do: 
-broadcast which board a players has
1. broadcast when player played card and is ready for "reveal" (and listen for other players)
2. broadcast what a player's choice is
3. sync the board according to the changes every round (which players played which cards)


start game:
v 1. join players to the room they choose
x 2. game "leader" chooses when to start game with current num of players (minimum 3)
3. assign each player a board (grab all boards, then update player db)
4. randomize neighbors (update each player's right and left neighbors in db)

game cycle:
1. give cards
	-grab correct deck from db
	-change each player's hand (db, hand object)
2. players make choices
	-check if each player can make move (db, helper functions)
	-wait until all players made choices
3. show everyone's cards
4. change game status
	-update each player's built cards/money (db)
	-update each player's "players" object
5. shuffle and shift hands
	-update each player's hand (db, hand object)

6. discard leftovers
	-update game's discard in db
7. war
