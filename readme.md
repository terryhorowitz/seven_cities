Seven Cities
------------

Seven Cities is an in-broswer multi-player game based on the popular board game 7 Wonders.
To allow real-time gameplay we implemented our own custom web-sockets system using socket.io. We also created animations with pure CSS, used Postgres/Sequelize for data modeling, Node.js for game logic, and AngularJS for the front-end.

You can visit the live site and play the game at [www.seven-cities.com](https://www.seven-cities.com)

Seven Cities was created by Meredith Coulis, Terry Horowitz, Leila Loezer, and Yuval Idan.
